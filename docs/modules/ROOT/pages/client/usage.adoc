= Usage

Using the client requires only an entry in the pom.xml file, depending on the desired JEE version:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>hu.icellmobilsoft.dookug</groupId>
   <artifactId>dookug-client-jee10</artifactId>
   <version>${version.dookug.client}</version>
</dependency>
----

or

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>hu.icellmobilsoft.dookug</groupId>
   <artifactId>dookug-client-jee8</artifactId>
   <version>${version.dookug.client}</version>
</dependency>
----

followed by an @Inject,

[source,java]
----
@Inject
private DookugClient dookugClient;
----

which defines client calls to all endpoints and allows the use of its offered methods.
The API calls are made using the https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-rest-client-2.0/microprofile-rest-client-spec-2.0.html[MicroProfile Rest Client], so configurations can be set using the familiar microprofile-config. (see below)

[WARNING]
====
It is the responsibility of the client application to mount resources under the `/home/icellmobilsoft/resources` mount point within the container that it uses, which are referenced in the templates!
