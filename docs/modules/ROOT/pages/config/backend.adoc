The module's configuration is managed via MicroProfile Config, which allows specifying necessary values in multiple ways.

MicroProfile Config can retrieve a given key from all available sources and uses the highest priority value.

The base configuration is provided via `project-defaults.yml`, which can be extended and may vary per environment. It's not necessary to specify every value; only those that differ from the default settings.

*Possible modes in order of priority:*

* System variables
* Environment variables
